## What is different from the original plugin?
This plugin is a fork of the original [Jetbrains Discord Integration plugin by Aljoscha Grebe (Almighty Alpagca)](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10233-discord-integration). I started this fork because the original plugin was not being updated anymore and left with a lot of bugs and compatibility issues. I also wanted to add some features that I thought were missing from the original plugin.
