## Why "v2"? What happened with the original plugin?
This plugin is a fork of the original [Jetbrains Discord Integration plugin by Aljoscha Grebe (Almighty Alpaca)](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10233-discord-integration). I started this fork because the original plugin was not being updated anymore and left with a lot of bugs and compatibility issues. I also want to add some features that are missing from the original plugin to allow even more customization.
